            Browser assets are stored in two distinct folders, based on whether
            these assets require processing or not.
          </p>
          <h2>Static Assets</h2>
          <p>
            Any assets that do not require processing (e.g., fonts, robots.txt,
            icons) should be placed in the <code>/public</code> directory. They
            will be served as static files from the root directory.
          </p>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th width="50%">Route path</th>
              <th width="50%">URL</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>public/robots.txt</td>
              <td>/robots.txt</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>public/fonts/ubuntu.woff2</td>
              <td>/fonts/ubuntu.woff2</td>
            </tr>
          </table>

          <h2>CSS & JavaScript</h2>
          <p>
            CSS, JavaScript, or TypeScript files that require processing and
            minification should be stored in the src/browser directory and must
            be named as <code>index.[css|js|jsx|ts|tsx]</code>. Only index files
            serve as bundle entries and are accessible to the client. This
            approach offers flexibility in creating a custom directory layout.
          </p>

            <tr>
              <th width="50%">Route path</th>
              <th width="50%">URL</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>browser/src/index.css</td>
              <td>/index.css</td>

            <tr>
              <td>browser/src/utils/date.js</td>
              <td>This file will be not available via an url.</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <Highlight title="Shared code">
            While you have the flexibility to share code between the server and
            browser, this is typically an edge case, as the DOM is not relevant
            on the server side, and node core modules are not compatible with
            the browser. To optimize build performance during development by
            efficiently minimizing unnecessary rebuilds, no rebuild is triggered
            when shared code changes per default.
          </Highlight>
          <p>
            You can easily configure additional paths which should be watched
            for building the browser bundles via an environment variable:
