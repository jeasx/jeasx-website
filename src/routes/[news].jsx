            Welcome to the news section of Jeasx. Here we are going to post
            updates about new features, bug fixes, and general information about
            the project. We are proud to announce that Jeasx is rock stable and
            ready for production. We are committed to keep the project as small
            as possible and focus on the core. Future updates are likely updates
            for 3rd party dependencies like fastify, esbuild and esbuild.

                It's finally here! Jeasx 1.0.0 is ready for production. We are
                proud to announce that the framework has reached feature
                completeness and is now ready for the masses. Lots of hours of
                work have been put into this project to make sure you have the
                best experience possible.

                Decorate the Fastify request object with "path" property, so you
                can easily access the route path without query parameters via{" "}
                <code>request.path</code>. This solves 99% of all use-cases for

                This release comes with Fastify 5. It also removes
                @fastify/url-data and @fastify/accepts as dependencies,
                therefore your <b>code might break.</b> The reason behind this
                removal is to depend on less dependencies in the long run which
                makes maintenance of the core easier.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you rely on either accepts or url-data, you must provide
                appropriate changes in userland code. For @fastify/url-data I
                would recommend to use{" "}
                <a href="https://github.com/fastify/fast-uri" target="_blank">
                  fast-uri
                </a>{" "}
                and for @fastify/accepts{" "}
                <a href="https://github.com/jshttp/accepts" target="_blank">
                  jshttp/accepts
                </a>{" "}
                for parsing accept-header if needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please note: there were some intermediate releases since the
                past proper release which shouldn't be used (and are mostly
                unpublished from npm).

                <b>Breaking change:</b> removed @fastify/request-context in
                favor of the recently introduced <code>this</code> context.
                Changing your code should be straightforward. This change
                decouples userland code from Fastify. Additionally code for
                Jeasx and jsx-async-runtime is provided unminified, so debugging
                and testing is far easier now.

                This release introduces a new feature that allows you to
                post-process the resulting payloads, such as prettifying the
                HTML output. You can now set up a response handler, for example,
                in a guard. The response handler takes the resulting payload as
                a parameter and returns the modified payload.
              </p>
