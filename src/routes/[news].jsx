            Welcome to the news section of Jeasx. Here we are going to post
            updates about new features, bug fixes, and general information about
            the project. We are proud to announce that Jeasx is rock stable and
            ready for production. We are committed to keep the project as small
            as possible and focus on the core. Future updates are likely updates
            for 3rd party dependencies like fastify, esbuild and esbuild.

              files (like <code>.env.development</code>) to configure different
              environments for production and development. This is useful to
              disable caching headers (e.g. via{" "}
              <code>FASTIFY_STATIC_HEADERS</code>) in development, as Jeasx
              applies <code>FASTIFY_STATIC_HEADERS</code> in development from
              now on for a more consistent developer expierence. See updated
              .env-files in the{" "}

              for an example how to disable caching in development. This is only
              needed if you have configured <code>FASTIFY_STATIC_HEADERS</code>{" "}

              Bumped default environment variable{" "}
              <code>ESBUILD_BROWSER_TARGET</code> to more recent browser
              versions (e.g.{" "}
              <code>chrome126, edge126, firefox128, safari17</code>). If you
              want to stick with older versions, you can override it via the
              environment. Learn more about possible values at the{" "}

              Updated <code>jsx-async-runtime</code> which fixes a bug in{" "}

              The default host is now <code>::</code> which binds to all
              available network interfaces (e.g. IPv6). You can change it via
              the <code>HOST</code> environment variable (e.g.{" "}
              <code>HOST=0.0.0.0</code> for the old behaviour). The change is
              especially useful to connect to Jeasx via private networking on

                It's finally here! Jeasx 1.0.0 is ready for production. We are
                proud to announce that the framework has reached feature

                work have been put into this project to make sure you have the

                This release comes with Fastify 5. It also removes
                @fastify/url-data and @fastify/accepts as dependencies,
                therefore your <b>code might break.</b> The reason behind this
                removal is to depend on less dependencies in the long run which
                makes maintenance of the core easier.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you rely on either accepts or url-data, you must provide
                appropriate changes in userland code. For @fastify/url-data I
                would recommend to use{" "}
                <a href="https://github.com/fastify/fast-uri" target="_blank">
                  fast-uri
                </a>{" "}
                and for @fastify/accepts{" "}

                  jshttp/accepts
                </a>{" "}
                for parsing accept-header if needed.

                Please note: there were some intermediate releases since the

                <b>Breaking change:</b> removed @fastify/request-context in
                favor of the recently introduced <code>this</code> context.
                Changing your code should be straightforward. This change
                decouples userland code from Fastify. Additionally code for
                Jeasx and jsx-async-runtime is provided unminified, so debugging
                and testing is far easier now.

                post-process the resulting payloads, such as prettifying the

                a parameter and returns the modified payload.
