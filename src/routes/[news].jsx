                This releases fixes status codes for fallback 404 routes. Due to
                an unnoticed bug introduced by a minor refactoring, 404-routes
                were delivered with <code>status=200</code>, now it is the
                correct <code>status=404</code> again. This might impact your
                SEO score, so an update is highly recommended.

              <p>
                🎉 Approximately one year after the release of Jeasx 1.0 I'm
                proud to announce the release of Jeasx 2.0. It's a funny
                story... every time I think Jeasx is feature-complete, there is
                still some more room to improve. Although the main idea behind
                Jeasx development still holds true: focus on a lean and stable
                core and let developers do all their magic in userland.
              </p>
              <p>
                This release is focused on security and comes with a{" "}
                <b>major breaking change:</b> all HTML markup is escaped by
                default from now on, so you don't have to escape dangerous user
                input on your own anymore. This way the developer experience is
                improved and the actual performance costs for automatic escaping
                are neglible due to the reuse of the highly optimized{" "}
                <a href="https://github.com/SukkaW/fast-escape-html">
                  fast-escape-html
                </a>{" "}
                library.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you need to include literal HTML in your JSX templates (e.g.
                HTML snippets from a CMS), you can use a special object syntax
                to opt out of escaping:{" "}
                <code>{
                  /*jsx*/ `{{ html: "<p>Some HTML from a CMS</p>" }}`
                }</code>
              </p>
              <p>
                If you want to migrate from Jeasx 1.0 to Jeasx 2.0 with
                automatic HTML escaping enabled, you'll need to remove all calls
                to <code>#escapeEntities()</code> and modify the HTML
                declaration in your layouts (
                <code>{`{{ html: "<!DOCTYPE html>" }}`}</code>). Then you should
                check where you need to render literal HTML (or other code) and
                apply the required changes to opt out of escaping (e.g.{" "}
                <code>{`<div>{ wysiwygContent }</div>`}</code> to{" "}
                <code>{`<div>{{ html: wysiwygContent }}</div>`}</code>).
              </p>
              <p>
                If you want to restore the non-escaping behaviour of Jeasx &lt;
                v2, you can set <code>jsxEscapeHTML = false</code> in the root
                guard. This way HTML escaping is disabled globally.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another internal change is the renaming of the directories in
                the output directory (<code>dist</code>): <code>routes</code> is
                now called <code>server</code> alongside the{" "}
                <code>browser</code> directory.

            <Definition title="2025-09-29 - Jeasx 1.9.0 released">
              <p>
                🎉 This release drops the constraint that you had to put all
                routes into a dedicated <code>routes</code>-directory and all
                JavaScript &amp; CSS into a dedicated <code>browser</code>
                -directory. From now on you can use any directory layout in your
                projects as you like. You can still use the proven{" "}
                <code>browser/routes</code> layout, but you don't have to.
              </p>
              <p>
                This feature enables the co-location of server and browser code
                in the same directory which might be a better default for your
                workflows.
              </p>
              <p>
                The only remaining constraint is to mark server routes with
                brackets (e.g. <code>[news].jsx</code>) and browser-bundled
                assets as index-files (e.g. <code>index.js</code> or{" "}
                <code>index.css</code>).
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Please note:</b> This feature is enabled by dropping the hard
                coded outbase-directories in the esbuild configuration. If the
                outbase directory isn't specified, it defaults to the lowest
                common ancestor directory among all input entry point paths.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you run into an edge case (e.g. your browser bundles won't
                load anymore), here's how to fix it: if you store all your
                assets in <code>browser/assets</code> and request your assets
                via <code>/assets/...</code>, this won't work anymore, because{" "}
                <code>assets</code> is now the lowest common ancestor directory
                and is removed by esbuild. Simple fix: just put an empty{" "}
                <code>index.js</code> into <code>browser</code> directory, so
                this directory is lowest common ancestor directory again.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bumbed the default <code>ESBUILD_BROWSER_TARGET</code> to{" "}
                <code>"chrome130", "edge130", "firefox130", "safari18"</code>.

                🎉 This release introduces a custom error handler to provide
                user-friendly error messages for internal server errors and to
                facilitate team notifications.
              </p>
              <p>
                To set up an error handler, simply register it in a route of

                An error handler is called with <code>this</code> as context,

                handler with the introduced error handler. We apologize for any
                inconvenience, but since this is a seldom-used feature, we aim
                to streamline the codebase by aligning it without maintaining

                Route loading in development has been enhanced. It now relies on
                the modification time of the module, eliminating the need to
                calculate a hash for the file content. Additionally, a redundant
                file existence check for route handlers has been removed,
                resulting in more streamlined core code.

                improves build performance because <code>esbuild</code> only

                This release comes with Fastify 5. It also removes
                @fastify/url-data and @fastify/accepts as dependencies,
                therefore your <b>code might break.</b> The reason behind this
                removal is to depend on less dependencies in the long run which
                makes maintenance of the core easier.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you rely on either accepts or url-data, you must provide
                appropriate changes in userland code. For @fastify/url-data I
                would recommend to use{" "}

                <b>Breaking change:</b> removed @fastify/request-context in

                Changing your code should be straightforward. This change
                decouples userland code from Fastify. Additionally code for
