            Welcome to the news section of Jeasx. Here we are going to post
            updates about new features, bug fixes, and general information about
            the project. We are proud to announce that Jeasx is rock stable and
            ready for production. We are committed to keep the project as small
            as possible and focus on the core. Future updates are likely updates
            for 3rd party dependencies like fastify, esbuild and pm2.
          </p>
          <Highlight title="2025-03-27 - Jeasx 1.7.0 released">
            <p>
              ðŸŽ‰ This release removes <code>pm2</code> as a dependency and
              utilizes the powerful file watching capabilities of{" "}
              <code>esbuild</code> directly. This enhancement significantly
              improves build performance because <code>esbuild</code> only
              re-compiles dependent files. Additionally, sharing code between
              the server and browser now works seamlessly without any additional
              configurations.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an added benefit, Jeasx now works with <code>Bun</code> as an
              alternative JavaScript runtime, although this setup is not yet
              recommended for development or production.

            <dd>
              <p>
                ðŸŽ‰ This release fixes a bug with the recently introduced env
                file loading. The env files were loaded in the wrong order, so
                that overwriting existing env variables didn't work.
              </p>

            <dd>
              <p>
                ðŸŽ‰ This release introduces a try/catch block in the central
                request handler, ensuring that proper error messages are logged.
                Additionally, it enables sourcemaps for both server and browser
                code, making debugging a breeze.
              </p>
              <p>
                To enable sourcemap support for Node.js, add the following code
                to the root of your project as a <code>.npmrc</code> file:
                <Code lang="ini" source="node-options=--enable-source-maps" />
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are using Docker, you need to modify the following lines
                in your Dockerfile to enable support for <code>.npmrc</code>:
              </p>
              <Code
                lang="docker"

                ðŸŽ‰ This releases replaces the dependency on{" "}

                introduced with Node v20.12.0) to load environment variables
                from .env-files. The order of loading .env-files is the same as
                before:

              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Breaking change:</b> If you use .env-files to configure Jeasx
                and deploy to Vercel, please update your{" "}
                <code>vercel.json</code>. You'll need to change{" "}
                <code>{`"includeFiles": "{node_modules,dist,public}/**/*"`}</code>{" "}
                to <code>{`"includeFiles": "./**/*"`}</code>
                to make sure Vercel includes the .env-files in the deployment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally a fix for correctly parsing environment variables
                to configure Fastify (
                <code>
                  FASTIFY_DISABLE_REQUEST_LOGGING, FASTIFY_TRUST_PROXY
                </code>
                ) was implemented.

                ðŸŽ‰ This release features an updated{" "}
                <code>jsx-async-runtime@0.8.1</code> which brings typings for
                SVGs for a better developer experience in the IDE of your
                choice.
              </p>

                ðŸŽ‰ This release adds the <code>route</code> property to the
                current endpoint handler (e.g., <code>/[index]</code> or{" "}
                <code>/bar/[...path]</code>) to the request object (accessible
                via <code>request.route</code>). This makes it much easier to
                calculate trailing path segments for wildcard routes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also several dependencies were updated to the latest versions:

                The updated version of jsx-async-runtime now supports using an
                array of strings for the <code>class</code> attribute, making it
                easier to create complex classnames. You can now construct
                classnames using plain strings or template strings, an array of
                strings, or an object, covering most use-cases known from other
                libraries like classnames.

              <p>
                ðŸŽ‰ This release fixes a bug introduced by the recently
                introduced route caching feature: if a guard returned different
                response types (e.g. JSX code for a forbidden route, otherwise
                props for the guarded routes), the guarded routes weren't
                resolved anymore.

            <dd>
              <p>
                ðŸŽ‰ This release brings a major performance boost (
                <b>about 2-5 times faster in benchmarks</b>) by introducing
                runtime caches for resolved routes and loaded JavaScript
                modules. The caches are only used in production and won't
                interfere with your development workflow. This change was
                triggered by a{" "}

                Added two new environment variables (
                <code>FASTIFY_DISABLE_REQUEST_LOGGING</code> and{" "}
                <code>FASTIFY_TRUST_PROXY</code>) to give you more control over

                <code>.env*</code> files (like <code>.env.development</code>) to
                configure different environments for production and development.
                This is useful to disable caching headers (e.g. via{" "}
                <code>FASTIFY_STATIC_HEADERS</code>) in development, as Jeasx
                applies <code>FASTIFY_STATIC_HEADERS</code> in development from

                Bumped default environment variable{" "}
                <code>ESBUILD_BROWSER_TARGET</code> to more recent browser
                versions (e.g.{" "}
                <code>chrome126, edge126, firefox128, safari17</code>). If you
                want to stick with older versions, you can override it via the

                Updated <code>jsx-async-runtime</code> which fixes a bug in{" "}
                <code>escapeEntities</code> which escaped existing{" "}

              <p>
                The default host is now <code>::</code> which binds to all
                available network interfaces (e.g. IPv6). You can change it via
                the <code>HOST</code> environment variable (e.g.{" "}
                <code>HOST=0.0.0.0</code> for the old behaviour). The change is
                especially useful to connect to Jeasx via private networking on

                It's finally here! Jeasx 1.0.0 is ready for production. We are
                proud to announce that the framework has reached feature
                completeness and is now ready for the masses. Lots of hours of
                work have been put into this project to make sure you have the
                best experience possible.

                This release comes with Fastify 5. It also removes
                @fastify/url-data and @fastify/accepts as dependencies,
                therefore your <b>code might break.</b> The reason behind this
                removal is to depend on less dependencies in the long run which
                makes maintenance of the core easier.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you rely on either accepts or url-data, you must provide
                appropriate changes in userland code. For @fastify/url-data I
                would recommend to use{" "}
                <a href="https://github.com/fastify/fast-uri" target="_blank">
                  fast-uri
                </a>{" "}
                and for @fastify/accepts{" "}
                <a href="https://github.com/jshttp/accepts" target="_blank">
                  jshttp/accepts
                </a>{" "}
                for parsing accept-header if needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please note: there were some intermediate releases since the
                past proper release which shouldn't be used (and are mostly

                <b>Breaking change:</b> removed @fastify/request-context in
                favor of the recently introduced <code>this</code> context.
                Changing your code should be straightforward. This change
                decouples userland code from Fastify. Additionally code for
                Jeasx and jsx-async-runtime is provided unminified, so debugging
                and testing is far easier now.

                This release introduces a new feature that allows you to
                post-process the resulting payloads, such as prettifying the
                HTML output. You can now set up a response handler, for example,
                in a guard. The response handler takes the resulting payload as
                a parameter and returns the modified payload.
