It's easy to get started. Just use the following commands to set up and start your first project:
</Lead>

```bash
npm create jeasx@latest
cd jeasx-quickstart
npm run build
npm run dev
```

If you want to create a new project with a specific name, you can provide an additional argument:

```bash
npm create jeasx@latest my-awesome-project
```

If your project is successfully started, just visit `http://localhost:3000/` in a browser of your choice.

If you want to see the quickstart example in action, you can visit a deployed version of the quickstart template at [https://quickstart.jeasx.dev](https://quickstart.jeasx.dev). The contents of the quickstart template can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/jeasx/jeasx-quickstart).

<Highlight title="Which JavaScript runtime should I use?">
Jeasx is developed and tested with the <b>latest LTS</b> version of Node.js (currently Node 24). Older versions are not officially supported, but may work. Newer Node versions should work without problems, but are not recommended for production.

Jeasx is tested against Bun and all [Jeasx examples powered by Bun](https://bun.jeasx.dev) are working without any issues, so Bun can be considered as a stable platform for running Jeasx.

If you encounter any issues, feel free to [report them](https://github.com/jeasx/jeasx/issues).

```

## Install project with Vercel support

If you are going to deploy your project on Vercel, you can bootstrap a project with additional resources (`vercel.json`, `api/vercel.js`) via the following flag:
