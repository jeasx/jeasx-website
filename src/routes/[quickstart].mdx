It's easy to get started. Just use the following commands to set up and start your first project:
</Lead>

```bash
npm create jeasx@latest
cd jeasx-quickstart
npm run build
npm run dev
```

If you want to create a new project with a specific name, you can provide an additional argument:

```bash
npm create jeasx@latest my-awesome-project
```

If your project is successfully started, just visit `http://localhost:3000/` in a browser of your choice.

If you want to see the quickstart example in action, you can visit a deployed version of the quickstart template at [https://quickstart.jeasx.dev](https://quickstart.jeasx.dev). The contents of the quickstart template can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/jeasx/jeasx-quickstart).

<Highlight title="Learning by examples" variant={true}>
The best way to get to know Jeasx is by exploring the [Expo](https://expo.jeasx.dev), which showcases numerous examples using a variety of technologies. You can also easily clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jeasx/jeasx-expo) to experiment with the examples directly on your computer.

<Highlight title="Which JavaScript runtime should I use?">
Jeasx is developed and tested with the **latest release** version of Node.js (currently Node 25.x). The **latest LTS** version (currently Node 24.x) is officially supported and guaranteed to work without issues. Older versions are not supported, though they may work.

Jeasx is tested against Bun and all [Jeasx examples powered by Bun](https://bun.jeasx.dev) are working without any issues, so Bun can be considered as a stable platform for running Jeasx.

If you encounter any issues, feel free to [report them](https://github.com/jeasx/jeasx/issues).
