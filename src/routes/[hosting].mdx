Jeasx supports various hosting modes tailored to different needs and preferences. You can host Jeasx on a dedicated server or VPS, deploy it via a Docker container, or opt for a serverless approach.

## Hosting on a dedicated / virtual private server (VPS)

Typically, a Jeasx application requires around 35 MB of RAM and a single (v)CPU. Therefore the smallest server should get you started. Running Jeasx on a server involves installing Node.js (or Bun), building the application with `npm run build` and starting it with `npm start`. I highly recommend to use a process manager like [pm2](https://pm2.io) to keep your application running.

In order to minimise the CPU footprint of a Jeasx application, it is highly recommended that SSL termination is offloaded to a reverse proxy, such as [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com).

## Container based hosting

An powerful self-hosted option is to install [Dokploy](https://dokploy.com) on your server. Dokploy uses Docker under the hood and comes with a nice user interface to create deployments directly from GitHub.

For straightforward Node.js-based hosting, platforms like [Railway](https://railway.app) and [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com) are excellent choices. Both support deploying Docker containers, which I highly recommend as the default builders (e.g., Railpack / Buildpack) create containers that use significantly more resources than the optimized Dockerfile provided via the quickstart template.

If you prefer Docker containers exclusively with a fixed pricing model, [Sliplane](https://sliplane.io) is a viable option.

## Serverless hosting

For a serverless setup, [Vercel](https://vercel.com) is an option, as Jeasx can be bootstrapped with the necessary configurations via the quickstart template. Other serverless platforms should work with additional configurations, but I haven't tested any of them.
