Browser assets are stored in two distinct folders, based on whether these assets require processing or not.
</Lead>

## Static Assets

Any assets that do not require processing (e.g., fonts, robots.txt, icons) should be placed in the `/public` directory. They will be served as static files from the root directory.

<table>
  <tr><th style="width:50%">Route path</th><th style="width:50%">URL</th></tr>
  <tr><td>public/robots.txt</td><td>/robots.txt</td></tr>
  <tr><td>public/fonts/ubuntu.woff2</td><td>/fonts/ubuntu.woff2</td></tr>
</table>

## CSS & JavaScript

CSS, JavaScript, or TypeScript files that require processing and minification should be stored in the `src` directory and must be named as `index.[css|js|jsx|ts|tsx]`. Only index files serve as bundle entries and are accessible to the client. This approach offers flexibility in creating a custom directory layout.

*Please note:* Jeasx doesn't specify any hardcoded outbase directory for esbuild, so it defaults to the lowest common ancestor directory for all your browser assets. So when you put *all* your assets into a dedicated folder (e.g. `src/browser`), `browser` will be removed from the resulting path.

<table>
  <tr><th style="width:50%">Route path</th><th style="width:50%">URL</th></tr>
  <tr><td>src/index.css</td><td>/index.css</td></tr>
  <tr><td>src/custom/index.js</td><td>/custom/index.js</td></tr>
  <tr><td>src/utils/date.js</td><td>This file will be not available via an url.</td></tr>
</table>

*Please note:* as JavaScript or TypeScript is compiled to [ECMAScript modules (ESM) via esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#format-esm), you should add `type="module"` to your script tags to avoid subtle errors.
